# Hardware Components- Computer Memory  

Computer memory refers to the different types of data storage technology
used by a computer. Memory is a place where computer store data,
instructions and results temporarily or permanently. Mainly computer
memory can be classified into three, they are** primary memory,
secondary memory and tertiary memory.  **

They differ in the way used to store data. Data, intermediate results
and results of ongoing jobs are temporarily stored in Primary memory.
Secondary memory on the other hand permanently holds data and
information.  Data are stored in binary form in all types of memory.\
\
The key difference between primary and secondary memory is speed of
access.

**Primary memory** is also known as internal memory, main memory,
primary/internal storage device.  It includes register, cache memory,
ROM and RAM, and is located either in or close to the CPU on the
computer motherboard, enabling the CPU to read data from primary memory
very quickly indeed. It is used to store data that the CPU needs
immediately so that it does not have to wait for it to be delivered.  
Characteristics of Primary/Main Memory:·          

-   These are semiconductor memories.

-   It is known as the main memory.

-   Can be volatile or non-volatile memory

-   Data is erased if stored in voltile memory and is permanent when
    > stored in non-volatile memory

-   It is the working memory of the computer.

-   Faster than secondary memories.

-   A computer cannot run without the primary memory

-   Have low storage capacity when compared to secondary storage/memory
    > and more expensive

-   CPU can directly access data using bus

 

**i) Random Access Memory (RAM)**\
RAM refers to the main memory that microprocessor can read from and
write to. Data can be stored and retrieved at random from anywhere
within the RAM, no matter where the data is. Data or instructions to be
processed by the CPU must be placed in the RAM. The contents of RAM are
lost when power is switched off. Therefore, RAM is a volatile memory.

The speed of a RAM refers to how fast the data in memory is accessed. It
is measured\
in Mega Hertz (MHz). When a computer is in use, its RAM contains the
following:\
1. The operating system software.\
2. The application software currently being used.\
3. Any data that is being processed.

 RAM is mainly categorized into two, Static RAM and Dynamic RAM.

**Static RAM (SRAM)** stores a bit of data using the state of a six
transistor memory cell. It keeps data in the memory as long as power is
supplied to the system and does not need refreshing.  As such, SRAM is
faster but also more expensive, making DRAM the more prevalent memory in
computer systems.

**Dynamic RAM (DRAM)** stores a bit data using a pair of transistor and
capacitor which constitute a DRAM memory cell. Since transistors always
leak a small amount, the capacitors will slowly discharge, causing
information stored in it to drain; hence, DRAM has to be refreshed
(given a new electronic charge) every few milliseconds to retain data. 
It is slower, less expensive and consumes lesser power than SRAM.

**ii)Read Only Memory (ROM)        **\
ROM is a permanent memory that can perform only read operations and its
contents cannot be easily altered. ROM is non-volatile; the contents are
retained even after the power is switched off. ROM is used in most
computers to hold a small, special piece rograms called firmware. 
The  \'boot up\' program known as bootstrap instructions, software that
runs when the computer is switched on or \'boots up\'are usually found
in the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) chip, an example of the ROM. 
Bootstrap instructions check the computer\'s hardware and then loads the
operating system.  ROM is slower than RAM.

Some modified types of ROM are now in use, they are: \
**1. PROM -** Programmable ROM which can be programmed only once. PROMs\
are programmed at the time of manufacture.\
**2. EPROM -** Erasable Programmable ROM that can be erased using ultra
violet\
radiation and can be programmed using special electronic circuits.\
**3. EEPROM -** Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM which can be
erased and\
rewritten electrically.

Comparison between RAM and ROM memory

  **DIFFERENCE**      **RAM**                                                                                 **ROM**
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Data retention      RAM is a volatile memory which could store the data as long as the power is supplied.   ROM is a non-volatile memory which could retain the data even when power is turned off.
  Working type        Data stored in RAM can be retrieved and altered.                                        Data stored in ROM can only be read.
  Use                 Used to store the data that has to be currently processed by CPU temporarily.           It stores the instructions required during bootstrap of the computer.
  Speed               It is a high-speed memory.                                                              It is much slower than the RAM.
  CPU Interaction     The CPU can access the data stored on it.                                               The CPU can not access the data stored on it unless the data is stored in RAM.
  Size and Capacity   Large size with higher capacity.                                                        Small size with less capacity.
  Used as/in          CPU Cache, Primary memory.                                                              Firmware, Micro-controllers
  Accessibility       The data stored is easily accessible                                                    The data stored is not as easily accessible as in RAM
  Cost                Costlier                                                                                cheaper than RAM.

**iii) Cache memory**\
Cache memory is a small and fast memory between the processor and RAM
(main memory). Frequently accessed data, instructions, intermediate
results, etc. are stored in cache memory for quick access. When the
processor needs to read from or write to a location in RAM, it first
checks whether a copy of that data is in the cache. If so, the processor
immediately reads the cache, which is much faster than reading from RAM.
Cache is more expensive than RAM, but it is worth using it in order to
maximise system performance. Commonly used cache memories and their
capacities are Level 1 Cache (128 KB), Level 2 Cache (1 MB), Level 3
Cache (8 MB) and Level 4 Cache (128 MB).

*The advantages of cache memory are as follows −*

-   Cache memory is faster than main memory.

-   It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.

-   It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of
    time.

-   It stores data for temporary use.

*The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows −*

-   Cache memory has limited capacity.

-   It is very expensive.

i**v)Registers**

CPU contains a few special purpose, temporary storage units known as
registers. They are high-speed memory locations used for holding
instructions, data and intermediate results that are currently being
processed.

**A bus is a set of wires that is used to connect the different internal
components of the computer system for the purpose of transferring data
as well addresses amongst them.**

**\
Secondary memory** by contrast, is usually physically located within a
separate storage device, such as a hard disk drive or Solid State Drive
(SSD), which is connected to the computer system either directly or over
a network. The cost per gigabyte of secondary memory is much lower, but
the read and write speeds are significantly slower.  Characteristics of
Secondary Storage Devices:

-   These are magnetic and optical memories.

-   It is known as the backup memory, auxiliary memory

-   It is a non-volatile memory.

-   Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off.

-   It is used for storage of data in a computer or outside it

-   Computer may run without the secondary memory.

-   Slower than primary memories and less expensive

    Systems

Secondary storage systems can be classified as follows:

\(1\) Magnetic

\(2\) Optical

\(3\) Solid state

\(4\) Online storage systems

**Magnetic storage systems** can be defined as the storage systems that
store the data on a magnetised medium, with the help of magnetised
particles. Magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, hard disks, floppy disks are
examples of magnetic storage systems.

They can store any type of data, such as text, audio, video, image.

 

Magnetic tapes: The plastic tapes with magnetic coating that are used
for storing the data. They are similar to the normal recording tapes.
The data stored on the magnetic tapes can be accessed using the
sequential access method.

 

Magnetic Disks: A flat disk that is covered with magnetic coating for
holding information. It is used to store digital information in the form
of small and magnetised needles. These needles help in encoding a single
bit of information by getting polarized in one direction represented by
1, and opposite direction represented by 0. It allows the random access
of data and provides the facility of erasing and re-recording the data
as many times as required.

The **optical storage systems** use the laser light as the optical
medium to retrieve as well as record data.  The optical storage devices
are either read-only or writable.

**Solid-state Storage Devices** were developed in 1978 by Storage Tek
Company. They do not use magnetic and optical medium to store data.
Instead, use semiconductor devices. They contains all the properties of
hard disk drives to store the data and use solid-state memory, which has
no moving parts. The examples of SSD are flash memory cards and
Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices

**Cloud Storage Systems**

This is storage of data on servers that are provided as service by data
centres distributed globally.  As a result, the data that are stored
here can be accessed from multiple distributed connected resources from
anywhere in the world.  Cloud storage provide greater accessibility,
reliability, rapid deployment, strong protection for data backup,
archival and disaster recovery purposes.

**Tertiary Storage Device**\
\
It involves a robotic arm mechanism which will mount/dismount removable
mass storage media into a storage device.. It is a comprehensive
computer storage systemthat is usually very slow and so is usually used
to archive data that is not accessed frequently.  This type of storage
is used for storing extra-ordinarily large data stores accessed without
human operators.  Data are stored in magnetic tapes, magnetic disks,
optical storage devices and then stored in libraries to be further
accessed via the robotic arm.

**Role of different types of memories in** **computer**

Let us discuss an example of data processing. Consider the case of a
payroll program to calculate the salary of an employee. The data for all
the employees is available in the hard disk. All the data about a
particular employee is taken to the RAM and from there data related to
salary calculation (bonus, deductions, etc.) is taken to the cache. The
data representing the hours worked and the wages is moved to their
respective registers. Using data on the hours worked and the wage, ALU
makes calculations based on instructions from control unit. For further
calculations, it moves the overtime hours, bonuses, etc. from cache to
registers. As\
the CPU finishes calculations about one employee, the data about the
next employee is brought from secondary storage into RAM, then cache and
eventually into the registers.

Below table summarises the characteristics of the various kinds of data
storage in the storage hierarchy.
