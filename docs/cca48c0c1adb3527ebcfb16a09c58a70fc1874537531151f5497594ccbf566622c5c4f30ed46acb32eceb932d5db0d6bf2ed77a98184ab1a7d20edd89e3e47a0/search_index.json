It is an electronic machine that takes input from the user, processes the given input and generates output in the form of useful information. 1.2 Characteristics Speed: Computers can process data at an extremely fast rate.Computers need only a few seconds to complete a task that a normal human being may take days or even years to complete. Powerful computers are capable of performing billions of operations in one second. Accuracy: Computers generate accurate results. But faulty instructions may lead to faulty results. This condition is known as GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out). Diligence: Being a machine computer does not suffer from human traits of tiredness and lack of concentration. Reliability: A computer produces error-free results. At hardware level, it does not require any human intervention between its processing operations. Moreover, computers have built-in diagnostic capabilities, which help in continuous monitoring of the system. Storage capability: Computers can store large amounts of data and can recall the required information almost instantaneously. As the main memory of the computer is relatively small, data can be stored on secondary storage devices such as disks. The data stored in the disks can be accessed quickly for processing, as and when required. Versatility: Computers are versatile in nature. They can easily perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, at one moment, it can be used to draft a letter, another moment it can be used to play music and in between, one can print a document as well. All this work is possible by changing the program (computer instructions). Resource Sharing: In the initial stages of development, computers were isolated machines. With the advancement of technologies, computers can be connected with each other. This has made the sharing of costly resources like printers possible. Apart from resource sharing, data and information can also be shared among groups of computers, thus creating a large information and knowledge base. 1.3 Computer Evolution and Generations The evolution of computers began with manual computing devices like the Sand table and the Abacus, followed by automated computing devices like the difference engine and the analytical engine. Charles Babbage, a professor at the Cambridge University is considered to be the father of modern computers. 1.3.1 First Generation Computers Were those used during the period 1937-1956. These used vacuum tubes technology for calculation, storage and control purpose and so were invariably colossal. They were not easily transferable due to their immense size and it was important to always keep them in cool places. Dissipation of heat in large quantities made these computers prone to frequent hardware faults. Although fast in that time, they are the slowest when compared to the modern-day computers. These computers carried out complex mathematical computations efficiently and in a shorter span of time than when done manually. The programming in these computers was done in machine language (binary codes using 0 and 1). Figure 1.1: Vaccum tubes in first generation computer Multi-tasking using these computers were impossible because they were generally designed as special-purpose computers and could execute only one program at a time. These computers were expensive to operate and used a large amount of electricity. Some examples of first generation computers are ENIAC, EDVAC, EDSAC and UNIVAC. Programming language used was machine code. Punch cards and paper tapes served as the input device and output devices. Magnetic tapes and Magnetic drums were the main memory. Figure 1.2: Replacing a vaccum tube in ENIAC Figure 1.3: Magnetic drums Figure 1.4: Drum memory from the BESK computer Swedens first binary computer 1.3.2 Second Generation computers These were used during the period 1956-1963. The logic circuits in them use transistors in place of vacuum tubes in building the basic logic circuits. They were the fastest computing devices of their time; and were easier to program due to the use of assembly language. Assembly languages had to be translated into machine codes, using assemblers so that it was easier for the computer to process the codes. They could be transferred from one place to other very easily because they were small and light. Also, they required very less power in carrying out their operations. They were more reliable than the first generation computers as they did not require maintenance at regular intervals of time. Punched cards and magnetic tapes were the input/output devices. Magnetic core, magnetic tapes and magnetic discs were the main memory. Examples of computers in this generation are UNIVAC 1107, IBM 1401 Figure 1.5: UNIVAC 1107 Figure 1.6: A transistor 1.3.3 Third Generation computers Brought huge gains in computational power. Computers in this generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs), which are semiconductor devices with several transistors built into one physical component. These devices were than the previous generation. They could be installed very easily and required less space. Programming became easier due to the use of high-level languages and any type of application could be executed. They are easily transportable, more reliable and require less frequent maintenance schedules. Magnetic tapes and discs served as the main storage memory. However, the storage capacity of these computers was still very small and the performance of these computers degraded while executing large applications, involving complex computations because of the small storage capacity. The cost of these computers was very high and they had to be placed in air-conditioned places. Input was given using keyboard and output obtained via the monitor. Programs were written using Assembly language and High Level language. E.g. UNIVAC 1108. Figure 1.7: A third generation computer Figure 1.8: A third generation integrated circuit 1.3.4 Fourth Generation computers They used Large Scale Integration (LSI) technology and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology. The term Personal Computer (PC) became known to the people during this era. These computers are very powerful in terms of their processing speed, access time and storage capacity. Semi-conductor memories like Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM) came into existence. They are highly reliable and required very less maintenance. They are very user- friendly, versatile systems as the programs written on these computers are highly portable. They require very less power to operate. However, the soldering of LSI and VLSI chips on the wiring board was not an easy task and required complicated technologies to bind these chips on the wiring board. High level languages like Java, Kotlin, C# were used for programming. Advanced input and output devices were used e.g. optical readers, various types of keyboards, GUIs, paddles, joysticks, impact and non-impact printers, plotters. Computers could be linked together to form networks. Databases could also be created for data processing during this generation. Figure 1.9: A very large scale integrated circuit 1.3.5 Fifth Generation Computers These are different types of modern digital computers. These use Ultra Large Scale Integration technology that allows almost ten million electronic components to be fabricated on one small chip. They are the fastest and powerful computers till date. They have the capacity to execute a large number of applications at the same time and that too at a very high speed, thereby decreasing their size. This generation of computers use microprocessors for parallel processing. They are extremely user-friendly and are versatile for communications and resource sharing. The expert system concept is used in these systems. The expert system is defined as a computer information system that attempts to mimic the thought process and reasoning of experts in specific areas. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a series of related technologies that tries to simulate and reproduce human behavior, including thinking, speaking and reasoning. Most high level languages like C++. Java, Python, R can be used for programming. Input/output devices are highly advanced and can use Bluetooth technology and printers can be connected through wiFi technology to communicate. Computers sizes have reduced considerably and can be carried in the pockets. Example of fifth generation computers are Smartphones, tablets, notebooks, laptops, desktops. Figure 1.10: An ultra large scale integrated circuit 1.3.6 Sixth Generation These computers uses lots of parallel computing. This generation shows vast potential for improved wide area networking utilising the explosive increase in network bandwidths. Computer storage capacity has increased tremendously and Solid State Devices can be embedded in the computer for large storage space at cheaper and efficient rates. 1.4 Computer Classification Classification of computers can be made based on operating principles, applications, function, and size and capability 1.4.1 Based on operating principles Analog Digital Hybrid Analog computers: represent data in the form of continuous electrical signals having a specific magnitude. They work on the principles of measurement. They are very fast and allow several operations to be carried out simultaneously. However, the results produced by these computers are not very accurate. Therefore, the analog computers are widely used in applications in which accuracy of results is not a major concern. They are powerful tools to solve differential equations. Digital computers: store and process data in the digital form (0 and 1). The outputs produced by these computers are also in the digital form. Digital computers are generally faster and more reliable than the analog computer systems and provide more accurate results. Hybrid computers: a combination of analog computer and digital computer because it encompasses the best features of both. They use analog for computation and digital for storage. These features make the hybrid computers very fast, efficient and reliable. They are less expensive than digital computers. 1.4.2 Based on application General purpose computers that can work in all environments. They are versatile and can store a number of programs meant for performing distinct tasks. However, they are not efficient and consume a large amount of time in generating a result. Special purpose computers that can perform only a specified task. They are not versatile and their speed and memory size depend on the task that is to be performed. They are less expensive. They are efficient and consume less amount of time in generating the result. 1.4.3 Based on Size and Capability Microcomputers (Personal Computers) Mini Computers Mainframe Computers Super Computers Microcomputer was designed to be used by individuals. These computers include Desktop Computers- which includes a box and a monitor on a table; In-car computers (carputers)  which are built into a car, for entertainment or navigation and Game consoles- video games use computers such as these. Smaller microcomputers are also called mobile computer devices. Some examples are: Laptops and portable computers  Portable and all in one case. Tablet Computer- Like laptops, but with a touch screen that replaces the keyboard Smartphones, smart-books, palmtop computers- Small handheld computers with limited hardware Programmable calculator - Like small handhelds, but specialized on mathematical work. Handheld game consoles- The same as game consoles, but small and portable. Mini computers were developed in mid 60s. They were also called mid-range computers and used 16 bit processors. The mini computer is a small digital computer whose process and storage capacity is lesser than that of a mainframe, but more than that of micro-computer. Its speed of processing data is in between that of a mainframe and a micro-computer. Mini computer is designed to meet the computing needs for several people simultaneously in a small to medium-sized business environment. It is capable of supporting form 4 to about 200 simultaneous users. It serves as a centralised storehouse for a cluster of workstations or as a network server. mainframe computer is an ultra-high performance computer made for high-volume, processor-intensive computing. It consists of a high-end computer processor, with related peripheral devices, capable of supporting large volumes of data processing, high performance online transaction processing systems, and extensive data storage and retrieval. Mainframes are the second largest (in capability and size) of the computer family, the largest being super computers. However, mainframes can usually execute many programs simultaneously at a high speed whereas super computers are designed for single process. Mainframe computers are very large, expensive, powerful and can handle millions of users at a time. They can process immense data volumes quickly. Their speed is measured in MIPS (Millions of Instructions per Second). Mainframe allows its user to maintain large information storage at a centralized location and be able to access and process this data from different computers located at different locations. It is typically used by large businesses and for scientific purposes. Super computers are high speed computers with extremely high processing, storage and computing capabilities. Super computers are the special purpose machines. A super computer has the highest processing speed at a given time for solving scientific and engineering problems. Essentially, it contains a large number of CPUs that operate in parallel to make it faster. Due to this feature, super computers are used in many applications. A super computer can process a great deal of information and make extensive calculations very quickly. Supercomputer processing speeds are measured in floating point operations per second, or FLOPS. It can resolve complex mathematical equations in a few hours, which would have taken a scientist with paper and pencil a lifetime, or years, using a hand calculator. It is the fastest, costliest and the most powerful computer available today. Typically, super computers are used to solve complex mathematical problems. PARAM is a super computer developed in India. 1.4.4 Based on Function Servers Workstations Embedded computers Information Appliance Computers Servers A server is a computer that is dedicated to provide service to other computers on a network. workstation was intended to serve a single user. It can also be termed as a terminal at the user end of a computer network. Embedded computers are a part of a device and usually execute a program that is stored in the non-volatile memory of the system. These computers exist in digital watches, MP3 players, traffic signals, avionics, microcontroller chip, factory controllers. Information Appliance computers are designed to exclusively perform a singular user-friendly task such as playing music, or photography or edit text. "],["hardware--central-processing-unit.html", "Chapter 2 Hardware- Central Processing Unit 2.1 The central processing unit (CPU) 2.2 Internal Communication of CPU", " Chapter 2 Hardware- Central Processing Unit 2.1 The central processing unit (CPU) CPU is the computer component that is responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the other hardware and software of the system. It is considered to be the brain of the computer as most of the processing work is done here. CPU performs all types of data processing operations, stores data, intermediate results and instructions (program), and controls the operation of all parts of the computer. It relies on a chipset located on the motherboard. This chipset containing millions of tiny transistors that manipulate data that is being input into the computer. The measurement used to compute speed of a CPU is Hertz. The speed of the CPU is determined by a clock cycle, which means number of pulses per second. When there are more number of pulses/second, the processor is capable of processing more data. CPU also has cache memory that is a buffer between the RAM and the processor. The cache memory stores the most frequently used data and instructions for immediate access and helps to reduce average data access time from the main memory. Some CPUs have multiple processors on a single chip and are called microprocessors. Computer Type Speed Personal Computers Mega Hertz (MHz) and Giga Hertz (GHz) WorkStations/Mini Computers / Mainframes Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS) and Billions of Instructions Per Second (BIPS) Super Computers Millions of FLoating point Operations Per Second (MFLOPS), Billions of FLOPS called GFLOPS and TeraFLOPS, (TFLOPS = 1012) ### Types of processors Processors are manufactured by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and so these are the only two types of computer processors available in the market today. Intel's desktop CPUs include Celeron, Pentium and Core. Based on expression of information they can be either 32 bit or 64 bit. Three types of processors are: Complex Instruction Set Computer architecture (CISC) that have large instruction sets, variable length instructions and varied addressing modes Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture (RISC) which have smaller instruction sets and place extra demand on the programmers Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC)  this permits the processor to perform operations in a parallel fashion The CPU performs Arithmetic operations, extracts data from memory and executes commands. In processing data, the CPU performs four basic steps: Fetch: Each instruction is stored in memory and has its own address. The processor takes this address number from the program counter, which is responsible for tracking which instructions the CPU should execute next. 2.1.1 Components of the CPU Control Unit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) Registers Figure 2.1: An ultra large scale integrated circuit Although the main memory was once considered to be part of the CPU, today as the boundaries shift, it has become a separate entity and the CPU now comprises of registers and cache memory for temporary storage of data. 2.1.1.1 Registers These are storage areas that store data, instructions and intermediate results temporarily. They are not part of the memory and work under the direction of the Control Unit, so as to provide additional storage and enhance space speed. They provide information to other units of the computer when needed. They accept, temporarily hold and transfer instructions and data, and help with the arithmetic and logic operations. The functions of these registers are: Storage of all the data and the instructions required for processing. Storage of intermediate results of processing. Storage of the final results of processing before these results are released to an output device. All inputs and outputs are transmitted through these registers The data/information stored in the registers are in the form of binary digits (bits), 0 and 1. (8 bits = 1 byte) They are used for Instant Access Storage. These registers have been assigned specific names and related roles as follows: Accumulator  holds the instruction that is to be executed, the data to be manipulated and the results of computation Memory Address Register  to keep track of the active memory location Memory Buffer Register  to temporarily hold data or results taken from or to be placed in memory Program Control Register  holds the address of the next instruction that is to be accessed Input /Output Register  to communicate with the input/output devices General-Purpose Register  that is used for a variety of functions 2.1.1.2 Control Unit This unit has circuits that utilise electrical signals to controls the operations of all parts of the computer related to storage and execution of instructions, by communicating with the ALU and the memory. However, it does not carry out any actual data processing operations. Functions of this unit are  It is responsible for controlling the transfer of data and instructions among other units of a computer. It manages and coordinates all the units of the computer. It obtains the instructions from the memory, interprets them, and directs the operation of the computer. It communicates with Input/ Output devices for transfer of data or results from storage. It does not process or store data. 2.1.1.3 ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) This unit contains circuits that perform both arithmetic and logical operations. Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are the four arithmetic operations performed by the ALU. The cost of the ALU increases as the operations performed by it becomes complex and more heat is dissipated. Logical operations pertaining to comparisons between numbers, between letters or between characters are also performed by the ALU. The ALU consists of two subsections namely, Arithmetic Unit Logic Unit 2.1.1.3.1 Arithmetic Unit Function of arithmetic section is to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, through bit-shifting operations. All complex operations are done by making repetitive use of the above operations. In some processors there is one arithmetic unit for fixed-point operations and another for floating point calculations. 2.1.1.3.2 Logic Unit Function of logic section is to perform logic operations such as comparing, selecting, matching, and merging of data. Logical operations performed by the logical section are as follows: Equal-to condition (=). This is the test where two values are compared to check for equality. Less-than condition (&lt;). Comparison is made to check if value is less than the other. Greater-than condition (&gt;). In this case, two values are compared to check if one is greater than the other. Less than or equal to condition (&lt;=). Two values are checked to find if one is less than the other or atleast equal to it. Greater than or equal to (&gt;=). Two values are compared to check if one is greater than the other or atleast equal to it. Not equal to (=). Comparison between two values are made to show that they are not equal to each other. 2.2 Internal Communication of CPU Between CPU and the Memory - is connected by means of massive circuit board called motherboard and it contain small parts called buses which perform special functions Between the CPU and the Input/Output Devices - is also connected by buses and CU performs an important function "],["computer-software.html", "Chapter 3 Computer Software 3.1 Software 3.2 Utilities 3.3 Firmware 3.4 Assemblers 3.5 Compiler 3.6 Interpreter 3.7 Operating System 3.8 Examples of Operating Systems 3.9 Freeware, Shareware, Open Source Software", " Chapter 3 Computer Software 3.1 Software Software is a set of programs, procedures, algorithms and associated data, designed to perform a well-defined function. A program is a sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem. There are two types of software viz. Application Software and System Software (Platform Software) 3.1.1 Application Software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment. All software applications prepared in the computer lab can come under the category of Application software. Application software may consist of a single program, such as Microsoft's notepad for writing and editing a simple text. It may also consist of a collection of programs, often called a software package, which work together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet package. Examples are MS Word, MS Excel. MS Access, MS PP, notepad, payroll, mark sheet software, IT software, Aadhar Card software Application Software are generally written in High Level Language and so are easier to understand. They are comparatively easier to design, are close to the user and are generally more interactive. Manipulation, editing and use of application software are easier when compared to system software. However, since they have to be translated into machine language before being processed, they are slower. 3.1.2 System Software It is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. They are generally prepared by the computer manufacturers. These software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages, which interact with the hardware at a very basic level. System software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users. Some examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers, Interpreter and Assemblers System Software are generally written in low-level language and so are not easily understood by the user. However, they are close to the system and do not require any translation before being executed. Hence they have high speed. They possesses less interactive abilities, are small sized programs and are extremely difficult to design, manipulate and edit. 3.1.2.1 System Software Types Systems software can be categorized under the following: Operating system: Harnesses communication between hardware, system programs, and other applications (Windows, Unix, OSX) Device driver: Enables device communication with the OS and other programs Firmware: Enables device control and identification Translator: Translates high-level languages to low-level machine codes (Compilers, Assemblers, Interpreters) Utility: Ensures optimum functionality of devices and applications e.g. anti-virus software, backup software and disk tools Device Drivers These system software make it possible for all connected components and external add-ons to perform their intended tasks and as directed by the OS. Without drivers, the OS would not assign any duties to the components. Examples of devices which require drivers: are mouse, keyboard, soundcard, displaycard, network card and printer. Usually, the operating system come with drivers for most devices. By default, drivers for input devices such as the mouse and keyboard will be installed. If a device is newer than the operating system, the user may have to download drivers from manufacturer websites or alternative sources. 3.2 Utilities These are system software that exist between system and application software. They are diagnostic programs, perform maintenance tasks for the computer and ensure that the computer performs optimally. They focus on the operation of a computer and so are highly technical. Their tasks vary from crucial data security to disk drive defragmentation. Most are third-party tools but may come bundled with the operating system. Third-party tools are available individually or bundled together such as with Hiren Boot CD, Ultimate Boot CD, and Kaspersky Rescue Disk. 3.2.1 Examples of utility software Antivirus and security software for the security of files and applications, e.g., Malwarebytes, Microsoft Security Essentials, and AVG Disk partition services such as Windows Disk Management, Easeus Partition Master, and Partition Magic. Disk defragmentation to organize scattered files on the drive. Examples include Disk Defragmenter, Perfect Disk, Disk Keeper, Comodo Free Firewall, and Little Snitch Archivers whichoutput single file when the input is a directory or set of files a stream or a single file when provided with a directory or a set of files. Backup Software that duplicate/ mirror all files to utilise in case of a disk failure to restore all files. Clipboard Managers expand the clipboard functionality of an operating system. Cryptographic utilities encrypt and decrypt files. Data Compression utilities produces condensed and dense files as output when normal files are input Data Synchronisation utilities establish consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa. There are several branches of this type of utility: File synchronisation utilities maintain consistency between two sources. They may be used to create redundancy or backup copies but are also used to help users carry their digital music, photos and video in their mobile devices. Revision control utilities are intended to deal with situations where more than one user ttempts to simultaneously modify the same file. Disk Checkers which scan operating hard drive. Disk cleaners help the identification and deletion of superfluous files, or those that utilise excessive disk space. Disk Compression utilities can transparently compress/uncompress the contents of a disk, increasing the capacity of the disk. Disk space analysers assist in ascertaining folder and sub folder sizes and help determining the volume of disk space used. Disk storage utilities File manager utilities that help with normal data management tasks like deletion, insertion, move, copy, merge, modification and generation of data. Hex editors directly modify the text or data of a file. Memory testers check for memory failures. Network Utilities scrutinise network configuration, connectivity, settings, data transfer and log events Registry cleaner utilities clean and optimize the Windows Registry through removal of unused registry keys Screen savers were desired to prevent phosphor-burn-in on CRT and plasma computer monitors by blanking the screen or filling it with moving images or patterns when the computer is not in use. Contemporary screen savers are used primarily for entertainment or security. System monitor utility for monitoring resources and performance in a computer system. System profiler utility provide detailed information about the software installed and hardware attached to the computer. 3.3 Firmware It is the operational software embedded within a flash, ROM, or EPROM memory chip for the OS to identify it. It directly manages and controls all activities of any single hardware. Traditionally, firmware used to mean fixed software as denoted by the word firm. It was installed on non-volatile chips and could be upgraded only by swapping them with new, pre-programmed chips. This was done to differentiate them from high-level software, which could be updated without having to swap components. Today, firmware is stored in flash chips, which can be upgraded without swapping semiconductor chips. The most important firmware in computers today is installed by the manufacturer on the motherboard and can be accessed through the old BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or the new UEFI (Unified Extended Firmware Interface) platforms. It is the configuration interface which loads first when the computer is powered up and is going through POST (Power On Self Test). The user can change the BIOS and UEFI settings by pressing special keys (a function key, delete, or the esc key) at boot-up to load the configuration page Though they work differently, firmware compliments drivers in a few ways. Both give identity to hardware devices, with the latter making the operating system see the device. The major difference between the two is that firmware will always reside within devices while drivers will install within the operating system 3.4 Assemblers Assemblers are computer programs that translate programs written in Assembly Language into machine language. The translated program is called an object program. The Assembler checks the accuracy of each instruction and generates diagnostic messages, if there are errors in the program. Steps followed by Assemblers are: Input source program in Assembly Language through an input device. Use Assembler to produce object program in machine language. Execute the program. 3.5 Compiler Compiler is a program that translates codes written in High Level Languages (HLL), into executable machine language. This is a complex process when compared to the translation using assemblers. The compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution. During translation, compilers provide error messages after appropriate diagnosis of the HLL code. Each time the corrections have to be made and recompiled until all errors are resolved. Compilation involves Translation of the HLL source program to machine code Tracing of variables in the program Inclusion of subroutine links Memory allocation for the variables and program Generation of error messages , if required 3.6 Interpreter Interpreter is a program that translates codes written in HLL into machine codes. Each line of code is diagnosed for errors and error messages are given. Once errors are corrected, the line is translated into machine code, which is the executable version. This means that the interpreter translates each instruction, executes it and only then the next instruction is translated and this goes on until end of the program. In this case, object code is not stored and reused. Each time the program is executed, the interpreter translates each instruction afresh. The disadvantage of an interpreter is that Instructions in the program must be translated each time they are executed. Due to this, interpretation is 20 times slower that compilation 3.7 Operating System It is a program with the following features  An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the software and the computer hardware. It is an integrated set of specialized programs used to manage overall resources and operations of the computer. It is a specialized software that controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, including application programs and other system software. 3.7.1 Objectives of Operating System The objectives of the operating system are  To make the computer system convenient to use in an efficient manner. To hide the details of the hardware resources from the users. To provide users a convenient interface to use the computer system. To act as an intermediary between the hardware and its users, making it easier for the users to access and use other resources. To manage the resources of a computer system. To keep track of who is using which resource, granting resource requests, and mediating conflicting requests from different programs and users. To provide efficient and fair sharing of resources among users and programs. 3.7.2 Characteristics of Operating System Here is a list of some of the most prominent characteristic features of Operating Systems  Memory Management Keeps track of the primary memory, i.e. what part of it is in use by whom, what part is not in use, etc. and allocates the memory when a process or program requests it. Processor Management Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process and deallocates the processor when it is no longer required. Device Management Keeps track of all the devices. This is also called I/O controller that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time. File Management Allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides who gets the resources. Security Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means of passwords and other similar techniques. Job Accounting Keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs and/or users. Control Over System Performance Records delays between the request for a service and from the system.

This type of software generally has the lowest level of support available. 3.9.5 Bannerware It is when free software is distributed as a form of company advertisement "],["hardware-components--computer-memory.html", "Chapter 4 Hardware Components- Computer Memory", " Chapter 4 Hardware Components- Computer Memory Computer memory refers to the different types of data storage technology used by a computer. Memory is a place where computer store data, instructions and results temporarily or permanently. Mainly computer memory can be classified into three, they are primary memory, secondary memory and tertiary memory. They differ in the way used to store data. Data, intermediate results and results of ongoing jobs are temporarily stored in Primary memory. Secondary memory on the other hand permanently holds data and information. Data are stored in binary form in all types of memory. The key difference between primary and secondary memory is speed of access. Primary memory is also known as internal memory, main memory, primary/internal storage device. It includes register, cache memory, ROM and RAM, and is located either in or close to the CPU on the computer motherboard, enabling the CPU to read data from primary memory very quickly indeed. It is used to store data that the CPU needs immediately so that it does not have to wait for it to be delivered. Characteristics of Primary/Main Memory:· These are semiconductor memories. It is known as the main memory. Can be volatile or non-volatile memory Data is erased if stored in voltile memory and is permanent when &gt; stored in non-volatile memory It is the working memory of the computer. Faster than secondary memories. A computer cannot run without the primary memory Have low storage capacity when compared to secondary storage/memory &gt; and more expensive CPU can directly access data using bus i) Random Access Memory (RAM) RAM refers to the main memory that microprocessor can read from and write to. Data can be stored and retrieved at random from anywhere within the RAM, no matter where the data is. Data or instructions to be processed by the CPU must be placed in the RAM. The contents of RAM are lost when power is switched off. Therefore, RAM is a volatile memory. The speed of a RAM refers to how fast the data in memory is accessed. It is measured in Mega Hertz (MHz). When a computer is in use, its RAM contains the following: 1. The operating system software. 2. The application software currently being used. 3. Any data that is being processed. RAM is mainly categorized into two, Static RAM and Dynamic RAM. Static RAM (SRAM) stores a bit of data using the state of a six transistor memory cell. It keeps data in the memory as long as power is supplied to the system and does not need refreshing. As such, SRAM is faster but also more expensive, making DRAM the more prevalent memory in computer systems. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) stores a bit data using a pair of transistor and capacitor which constitute a DRAM memory cell. Since transistors always leak a small amount, the capacitors will slowly discharge, causing information stored in it to drain; hence, DRAM has to be refreshed (given a new electronic charge) every few milliseconds to retain data. It is slower, less expensive and consumes lesser power than SRAM. ii)Read Only Memory (ROM) ROM is a permanent memory that can perform only read operations and its contents cannot be easily altered. ROM is non-volatile; the contents are retained even after the power is switched off. ROM is used in most computers to hold a small, special piece rograms called firmware. The 'boot up' program known as bootstrap instructions, software that runs when the computer is switched on or 'boots up'are usually found in the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) chip, an example of the ROM. Bootstrap instructions check the computer's hardware and then loads the operating system. ROM is slower than RAM. Some modified types of ROM are now in use, they are: 1. PROM - Programmable ROM which can be programmed only once. PROMs are programmed at the time of manufacture. 2. EPROM - Erasable Programmable ROM that can be erased using ultra violet radiation and can be programmed using special electronic circuits. 3. EEPROM - Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM which can be erased and rewritten electrically. Comparison between RAM and ROM memory DIFFERENCE RAM ROM Data retention RAM is a volatile memory which could store the data as long as the power is supplied. ROM is a non-volatile memory which could retain the data even when power is turned off. Working type Data stored in RAM can be retrieved and altered. Data stored in ROM can only be read. Use Used to store the data that has to be currently processed by CPU temporarily. It stores the instructions required during bootstrap of the computer. Speed It is a high-speed memory. It is much slower than the RAM. CPU Interaction The CPU can access the data stored on it. The CPU can not access the data stored on it unless the data is stored in RAM. Size and Capacity Large size with higher capacity. Small size with less capacity. Used as/in CPU Cache, Primary memory. Firmware, Micro-controllers Accessibility The data stored is easily accessible The data stored is not as easily accessible as in RAM Cost Costlier cheaper than RAM. iii) Cache memory Cache memory is a small and fast memory between the processor and RAM (main memory). Frequently accessed data, instructions, intermediate results, etc. are stored in cache memory for quick access. When the processor needs to read from or write to a location in RAM, it first checks whether a copy of that data is in the cache. If so, the processor immediately reads the cache, which is much faster than reading from RAM. Cache is more expensive than RAM, but it is worth using it in order to maximise system performance. Commonly used cache memories and their capacities are Level 1 Cache (128 KB), Level 2 Cache (1 MB), Level 3 Cache (8 MB) and Level 4 Cache (128 MB). The advantages of cache memory are as follows  Cache memory is faster than main memory. It consumes less access time as compared to main memory. It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time. It stores data for temporary use. The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows  Cache memory has limited capacity. It is very expensive. iv)Registers CPU contains a few special purpose, temporary storage units known as registers. They are high-speed memory locations used for holding instructions, data and intermediate results that are currently being processed. A bus is a set of wires that is used to connect the different internal components of the computer system for the purpose of transferring data as well addresses amongst them. Secondary memory by contrast, is usually physically located within a separate storage device, such as a hard disk drive or Solid State Drive (SSD), which is connected to the computer system either directly or over a network. The cost per gigabyte of secondary memory is much lower, but the read and write speeds are significantly slower. Characteristics of Secondary Storage Devices: These are magnetic and optical memories. It is known as the backup memory, auxiliary memory It is a non-volatile memory. Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off. It is used for storage of data in a computer or outside it Computer may run without the secondary memory. Slower than primary memories and less expensive Magnetic Storage, Optical storage, Solid State Devices, Online Systems Secondary storage systems can be classified as follows: (1) Magnetic (2) Optical (3) Solid state (4) Online storage systems Magnetic storage systems can be defined as the storage systems that store the data on a magnetised medium, with the help of magnetised particles. Magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, hard disks, floppy disks are examples of magnetic storage systems. They can store any type of data, such as text, audio, video, image. Magnetic tapes: The plastic tapes with magnetic coating that are used for storing the data. They are similar to the normal recording tapes. The data stored on the magnetic tapes can be accessed using the sequential access method. Magnetic Disks: A flat disk that is covered with magnetic coating for holding information. It is used to store digital information in the form of small and magnetised needles. These needles help in encoding a single bit of information by getting polarized in one direction represented by 1, and opposite direction represented by 0. It allows the random access of data and provides the facility of erasing and re-recording the data as many times as required. The optical storage systems use the laser light as the optical medium to retrieve as well as record data. The optical storage devices are either read-only or writable. Solid-state Storage Devices were developed in 1978 by Storage Tek Company. They do not use magnetic and optical medium to store data. Instead, use semiconductor devices. They contains all the properties of hard disk drives to store the data and use solid-state memory, which has no moving parts. The examples of SSD are flash memory cards and Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices Cloud Storage Systems This is storage of data on servers that are provided as service by data centres distributed globally. As a result, the data that are stored here can be accessed from multiple distributed connected resources from anywhere in the world. Cloud storage provide greater accessibility, reliability, rapid deployment, strong protection for data backup, archival and disaster recovery purposes. Tertiary Storage Device It involves a robotic arm mechanism which will mount/dismount removable mass storage media into a storage device.. It is a comprehensive computer storage systemthat is usually very slow and so is usually used to archive data that is not accessed frequently. This type of storage is used for storing extra-ordinarily large data stores accessed without human operators. Data are stored in magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, optical storage devices and then stored in libraries to be further accessed via the robotic arm. Role of different types of memories in computer Let us discuss an example of data processing. Consider the case of a payroll program to calculate the salary of an employee. The data for all the employees is available in the hard disk. All the data about a particular employee is taken to the RAM and from there data related to salary calculation (bonus, deductions, etc.) is taken to the cache. The data representing the hours worked and the wages is moved to their respective registers. Using data on the hours worked and the wage, ALU makes calculations based on instructions from control unit. For further calculations, it moves the overtime hours, bonuses, etc. from cache to registers. As the CPU finishes calculations about one employee, the data about the next employee is brought from secondary storage into RAM, then cache and eventually into the registers. Below table summarises the characteristics of the various kinds of data storage in the storage hierarchy.
